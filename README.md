# 🛡️ UrgeShield

a clean, offline streak tracker to help fight urges and keep your progress locked in
\
\
what is it? \
this is a little app i made to track how long i've been clean from certain habits.
it’s simple, no signups, and no internet. just a way to log urges, record relapses, and stay on top of your goals.
\
\
it gives you motivation, protects your progress with a password, and keeps everything private.

# features:

🔐 password protected: first time you open it, it asks you to set a password

💪 urge logging: log when you fight the urge instead of giving in

😬 relapse logging: resets your streak and starts a cooldown (default 2 days)

🌱 motivational quotes: randomized and solid for keeping your head up

📁 stores data semi-privately: everything goes in %APPDATA%\UrgeShield, not next to the .exe

# how to use

download the .exe

run it: it’ll ask you to set a password the first time

done. now start logging your wins

# why i made it

i just wanted something super basic that didn’t make me feel like trash when i messed up.
most apps were either way too much or felt super judgey.
this one’s just for people trying to build better habits without all the noise.

# future plans (maybe?)

encrypted data \
graphing or streak visualization \
animations

# disclaimer

this app doesn’t collect anything. it runs locally.\
if you forget your password… that’s on you 😬\
jkjk, you can go to %APPDATA%\\UrgeShield\\password.txt to change it\
i used ai to help me make this since i cant code for shi so yeah
