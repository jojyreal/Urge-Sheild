Urge Sheild - A way to help end habits

🛡️ UrgeShield

a clean, offline streak tracker to help fight urges and keep your progress locked in
what is it?

this is a little app i made to track how long i've been clean from certain habits.
it’s simple, no signups, no internet, no guilt trips — just a way to log urges, record relapses, and stay on top of your goals.

it gives you motivation, protects your progress with a password, and keeps everything private.
features

    🔐 password protected — first time you open it, it asks you to set a password

    💪 urge logging — log when you fight the urge instead of giving in

    😬 relapse logging — resets your streak and starts a cooldown (default 2 days)

    🌱 motivational quotes — randomized and solid for keeping your head up

    📁 stores data privately — everything goes in %APPDATA%\UrgeShield, not next to the .exe

how to use

    download the .exe

    run it — it’ll ask you to set a password the first time

    done. now start logging those wins

why i made it

i just wanted something super basic that didn’t make me feel like trash when i messed up.
most apps were either way too much or felt super judgey.
this one’s just for me — and maybe for anyone else trying to build better habits without all the noise.
future plans (maybe?)

    hashed password storage (so it’s not readable)

    encrypted data

    optional cloud backup

    smoother graphing or streak visualization

disclaimer

this app doesn’t collect anything. it runs locally.
if you forget your password… that’s on you 😬
